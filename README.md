# Straight Down Beach Volleyball
## An HTML5 throwback to the classic 8-bit sports side-scrollers of the 80s

### Project overview
This repo uis basically a throwback to the 8-bit/16-bit titles I loved as a kid, with a modern twist. There are some unique features like a mode that lets Hangout participants "cheer on" a team to give them a [temporary performance boost](http://goo.gl/1B0fA), and an [instant replay mechanism](http://goo.gl/iUaTa) that I've not seen done before on the web. Half the fun will be putting this all together and making it work. [project overview](https://plus.google.com/+JasonSalas/posts/652t1swbg6X).

### Project features
This HTML5 game demonstrates a few techniques for web-based gaming:
- JavaScript animation loop (this should optimally use _requestAnimationFrame()_ but for simplicity it's a bare-bones implementation
- Responsive design for use on desktop, mobile, and TV browsers
- Keyboard, mouse, and touchscreen input for directional program control
- Multiplayer support (to be added!)
